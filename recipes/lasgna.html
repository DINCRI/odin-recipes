        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The secret here is using refrigerated crescent rolls as the crust. You'll add layers of seasoned ground beef, sour cream, and shredded cheese, topped with crushed tortilla chips. "It's a quick, easy meal that is very filling," says stephanie. "Some people will also top it with regular taco toppings, i.e. lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, etc. It also is great as leftovers for lunches! Serve with taco sauce."
